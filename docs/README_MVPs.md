## Tabs4Later

### Background

Tab management is a hassle.  Many users have 10+ tabs open at once due to researching/viewing multiple topics.  Tabs4Later reduces the number of running processes on the machine resulting in a cleaner, easier to use browser experience that is easy to use and easier on the computer. Users can save open tabs to be opened at a later time.  Temporarily closing tabs results in a faster web browsing experience.

### Functionality & MVP
- [ ] Users can create tab groups
- [ ] Moving a currently open tab into a tab group will close the tab and save it to a group
- [ ] Tabs can be re-opened at a later time
- [ ] Tabs4Later will replace the default new tab page
- [ ] Clicking new tab will open Tabs4Later and have the url be the default/selected input - just like how new tab is by default.  that way users can use it without much adjusting
